# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Node Redis is generally backwards compatible with very few exceptions, so we recommend users to always use the latest version to experience stability, performance and security.

See [Supported Redis Versions](https://github.com/redis/node-redis/blob/master/SUPPORTED_REDIS_VERSIONS.md).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you’ve discovered a serious vulnerability, please contact the Node Redis core team at redis@redis.io. We will evaluate your report and if necessary issue a fix and an advisory. If the issue was previously undisclosed,
we’ll also mention your name in the credits.
