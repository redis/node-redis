## Contributing

We'd love to see more examples here. If you have an idea that you'd like to see included here, submit a Pull Request and we'll be sure to review it! Don't forget to check out our [contributing guide](../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Setup

To set up the examples folder so that you can run an example / develop one of your own:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/redis/node-redis.git
cd node-redis
npm install -ws && npm run build
cd examples
npm install
```

### Coding Guidelines for Examples

When adding a new example, please follow these guidelines:

- Add your code in a single JavaScript or TypeScript file per example, directly in the `examples` folder
- Do not introduce other dependencies in your example
- Give your `.js` file a meaningful name using `-` separators e.g. `adding-to-a-stream.js` / `adding-to-a-stream.ts`
- Indent your code using 2 spaces
- Use the single line `//` comment style and comment your code
- Add a comment at the top of your `.js` / `.ts` file describing what your example does
- Add a comment at the top of your `.js` / `.ts` file describing any Redis commands that need to be run to set up data for your example (try and keep this minimal)
- Use semicolons
- Use `async` and `await`
- Use single quotes, `'hello'` not `"hello"`
- Use [template literals](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) when embedding expressions in strings
- Unless your example requires a connection string, assume Redis is on the default localhost port 6379 with no password
- Use meaningful example data, let's not use `foo`, `bar`, `baz` etc!
- Leave an empty line at the end of your `.js` file
- Update this `README.md` file to add your example to the table

Use [connect-as-acl-user.js](./connect-as-acl-user.js) as a guide to develop a well formatted example script.

### Example Template

Here's a starter template for adding a new example, imagine this is stored in `do-something.js`:

```javascript
// This comment should describe what the example does
// and can extend to multiple lines.

// Set up the data in redis-cli using these commands:
//   <add your command(s) here, one per line>
//
// Alternatively, add code that sets up the data.

import { createClient } from 'redis';

const client = createClient();

await client.connect();

// Add your example code here...

client.close();
```
