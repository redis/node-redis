# Supported Redis Versions

Node Redis is supported with the following versions of Redis:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 8.2.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 8.0.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 7.4.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| 7.2.z   | :heavy_check_mark: |
| < 7.2   | :x:                |

> Node Redis should work with older versions of Redis, but it is not fully tested and we cannot offer support.
